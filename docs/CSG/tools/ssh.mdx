## SSH-Key

Github provides a detailed guideline for SSH key. You can refer to this [site](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent).
Or you can also follow the simple steps below.
### Generate a new SSH key
Paste the following command in your terminal to generate a new SSH key pair.
Replace the email with your own email address.

```bash
# For usual server
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

# some legacy system (HEP1) only accepts RSA keys.
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

### Adding your SSH key to the ssh-agent

Start the ssh-agent in the background.
Depending on your shell, you may need to use different commands.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="bash">
For bash shell

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="csh/fish">

For csh/fish shell
```bash
eval (ssh-agent -c)
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Then add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Mac">

1. Modify `$HOME/.ssh/config` file to load ssh key into ssh-agent automatically
```bash title="~/.ssh/config"
Host github.com
  AddKeysToAgent yes
  UseKeychain yes
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

2. Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent and store your passphrase in the keychain.
```bash
ssh-add --apple-use-keychain ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Linux">

1. Add the ssh-key to ssh-agent

    ```bash
    ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
    ```

    You can check all the keys you add to the ssh-agent by `ssh-add -l`.

2. Add the following to your `~/.bashrc`. 
This will automatically start the agent and ensure that only one `ssh-agent` process is running at a time.

    ```bash title="~/.bashrc"
    #!/bin/bash

    if ! pgrep -u "$USER" ssh-agent > /dev/null; then
        ssh-agent -t 1h > "$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/ssh-agent.env"
    fi
    if [[ ! -f "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" ]]; then
        source "$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/ssh-agent.env" >/dev/null
    fi
    ```

3. Use `Keychain` to manage your keys, allowing you to avoid entering your password in each session.
   **install** `Keychain`. Then, add the following command to your `.bashrc` file to configure Keychain.

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    eval $(keychain --eval --quiet id_ed25519 id_rsa ~/.keys/my_custom_key)
    ```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Copy your public key pair to the server
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="By command">
Use command `ssh-copy-id` to copy your public key to the server.

```bash
ssh-copy-id -i your_key_path username@server_host
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Manually">

manually copy the public key to the server.
1. Copy the contents of file `$HOME/.ssh/your_key_path.pub`
2. Access the server and paste the contents into the `$HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys` file.
</TabItem>
</Tabs>


## SSH Configuration
The ssh configuration file is used to save the SSH setting for each server.
This can save you time and make your workflow more efficient. 

The SSH configuration file is located at **`$HOME/.ssh/config`** on Unix-like systems or **`c:\User\username\.ssh\config`** on Windows.
Here is an example configuration:

```sh title="~/.ssh/config"
Host <server_name>
  User <user_name>
  HostName <host_name>
  ForwardX11Trusted yes
  ForwardX11 yes
  UseKeychain yes # MacOS only
  AddKeysToAgent yes
  ForwardAgent yes
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
  LocalForward 8939 localhost:8939 # optional
```
Replace the placeholder in `<...>` with your information.
Then you can connect to this server by running **`ssh <server_name>`**.

:::danger
**NEVER** put your password in the configuration.
:::

### Legacy system
For connecting to the legacy system server (e.g. hep1), which requires RSA keys, you need to add specific flags to the configuration:

```sh title="~/.ssh/config"
Host hep1
   // highlight-start
  HostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa
  PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes=+ssh-rsa
  PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa
  // highlight-end
  User <user_name> 
  HostName hep1.phys.ntu.edu.tw
  ForwardX11Trusted yes
  ForwardX11 yes
  AddKeysToAgent yes
  UseKeychain yes # MacOS only
  ForwardAgent yes
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_hep1
```

### Jump host

Some servers cannot be directly connected to and require you to connect through a jump host (e.g., 'kekcc' and 'sshcc').
However, you can easily use a one-line command to jump to your target server.

```mermaid
graph LR;
    local --> sshcc --> kekcc;
```

Here is an example configuration:
```sh title="~/.ssh/config"
Host kekcc
  User Username
  HostName ccx04.cc.kek.jp
  ForwardX11Trusted yes
  ForwardX11 yes
  UseKeychain yes # MacOS only
  AddKeysToAgent yes
  ForwardAgent yes
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
  // highlight-next-line
  ProxyCommand ssh -q -W %h:%p sshcc

Host sshcc
  User Username
  HostName sshcc1.kek.jp
  ForwardX11Trusted yes
  ForwardX11 yes
  AddKeysToAgent yes
  UseKeychain yes # MacOS only
  ForwardAgent yes
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```
Then you can connect to 'kekcc' by running **`ssh kekcc`**.
