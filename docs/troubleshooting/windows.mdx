This page lists common issues that Windows users may encounter and provides solutions.

## WSL: X11 not working.
### ERROR: `Can't open display`
### Solution:
**Case 1**: Add `export DISPLAY=:0` in `~/.bashrc`.

**Case 2**: Update wsl as following command

    ```sh title="power shell"
    PS > wsl --update
    PS > wsl --shutdown
    ```
    
    then retry the x11 in sub system.
    
    ``` sh title="ubuntu bash"
    $ xeyes
    ```
### (Win10) X-windows not working
**ERROR**: `Authorization required, but no authorization protocol specified`

#### Solution
1. Install VcxSrv
    1. Execute with option “-ac” in "Additional Parameters for VcxSrv" textbox.

    2. You can save the configuration to prevent typing parameter everytime.
2. Set environment variables

    ```sh title="~/.bashrc"
    #!/usr/bin/env sh
    export DISPLAY=$(grep nameserver /etc/resolv.conf | sed ’s/nameserver //‘):0
    export LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=1
    ```

    :::note 
    The output of $(grep …) is the IP address addressing to x-window. THIS ADDRESS CHANGED AFTER REBOOT. So NEVER record the output address to .bashrc. Instead, use this command to update IP address everytime.

## VSCode

### Cannot SSH to the remote server due to glibc \< 2.28.

#### Description
After the VSCode 1.86 update, remote host Linux systems with glibc < 2.28 are no longer supported.

#### Solution
- To deal with this problem you need to downgrade the VSCode:  [[Win](https://update.code.visualstudio.com/1.85.2/win32-x64-user/stable)] [[Mac](https://update.code.visualstudio.com/1.85.2/darwin-universal/stable)]

    [vscode v1.85](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_85)
    
- You also need to switch the Extension “**Remote - SSH”** to the pre-release Version.
