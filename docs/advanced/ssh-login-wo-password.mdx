title: SSH Login Without Password
---
There are several ways to login to the server without a password.

## SSH key authentication

:::danger
For security, it is you must add a passphrase to the SSH key.
:::

SSH key is the best and most convenient method for SSH authentication.
With ssh-agent, you can easily implement ssh password-free login.
Please refer to the GitHub document for a detailed setup:
[Generating a new SSH key and adding it to the ssh-agent - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)

The only disadvantage of SSH key is that some servers (e.g. grid5, lxplus) do not allow SSH key authentication and must use a password. 

# 2. The `SSH_ASKPASS`

If you must use a password login because the server manager requires it, this method is probably a good solution for you.
You can just follow this site, it is clear enough.
[Say 'No' to sshpass](https://verynomagic.com/2015/06/say-no-to-sshpass.html).
To prevent this site from dead, I'll explain how to set it up below.

## Setup:

:::info
This setup method is only for MacOS. If you are using a different operating system, you will need to find the setup instructions on your own.
:::

1. Store your password in `Keychain Access.app` which is the default app in MacOS.
<details>
<summary>For anybody donâ€™t know how to do:</summary>

    1. Open the `Keychain Access.app` 
    2. Press `âŒ˜ + N` to add a new password.
    3. Remember your `itemName` and `accountName`. They will be used later.
</details>

2. Place the following code in the file `~/.local/bin/askpass` (or any path you want). 
    
    ```sh title="~/.local/bin/askpass"
    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    /usr/bin/security find-generic-password -a <accountName> -s <itemName> -w
    ```
    :::tip
      This script works only for a single password. If you have multiple settings, you will need to make some changes.
    :::

3. make it executable:
    
    ```bash
    $ chmod u+x ~/.local/bin/askpass
    ```
    
4. install `notty` following the GitHub repo. You need to compile it by yourself.
    
    [GitHub - pharaujo/notty: notty is a command line tool to detach a process from a tty.](https://github.com/pharaujo/notty)
    
5. Create another script `~/.local/bin/myssh`
    
    ```sh title="~/.local/bin/myssh"
    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    
    export DISPLAY=:99
    export SSH_ASKPASS="$HOME/.local/bin/askpass"
    
    notty ssh $@
    ```
    
6. Then you can use `myssh USER@HOSTNAME` to log in ssh server without a password.
    
    :::note
        Donâ€™t forget to add the path: `~/.local/bin` (or your path) to $PATH
        ```sh title="~/.bashrc"
        export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
        ```

# 3. iTerm2 password manager

- Using iTerm2 is an easy way, you donâ€™t need to set up anything.
- You only need to press `Enter` every time.
- Press `âŒ¥ âŒ˜ F`, open the â€˜Password Managerâ€™, and you can add your password to it.

# 4. Termius

Termius is an SSH client that remembers your password.
It doesn't use X11 forwarding, but you can use other drawing methods to get around it.
It is basically free, and you can request [GitHub education](https://education.github.com/) to get the full version.

# 5. `sshpass` (!!SECURITY RISK!!)

:::danger
ðŸš« DO NOT use sshpass for security reasons.
:::

sshpass is very unsafe because it uses the password in plain words.
Even you can't install it from the homebrew.
So if you are using this way, please change to another method on this page.
